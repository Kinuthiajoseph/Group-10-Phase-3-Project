    "The purpose of the prediction model is to leverage machine learning, specifically linear regression, to analyze historical data on mass shooting incidents and relevant variables. By identifying potential risk factors and patterns, the model aims to assist in understanding the factors contributing to mass shootings and informing evidence-based strategies for prevention."

    "\n",
    "Mass shooting incidents in the United States have had a devastating impact on communities, prompting the need for effective preventive measures to address this critical issue. This research aims to develop a prediction model using machine learning techniques to identify potential risk factors and patterns associated with mass shooting incidents. By analyzing historical data on mass shootings, demographics, mental health indicators, and other relevant variables, this study seeks to assist authorities and policymakers in understanding and mitigating the risk of such events."

    "The research will adopt a data-driven approach, utilizing the provided dataset on mass shooting incidents, along with demographic data, mental health indicators, and other relevant variables. The dataset will be preprocessed to handle missing values and transformed to ensure compatibility with the linear regression model. Feature selection techniques may be applied to identify the most important variables for the model. The linear regression model will be trained and evaluated to assess its predictive performance."
